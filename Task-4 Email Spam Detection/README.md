# Task 4 – Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## Objective
To classify emails/SMS messages as spam or non-spam using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle – SMS Spam Collection Dataset

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer

## Work Done
- Data cleaning and label encoding
- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, stopwords removal, stemming)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Model training using Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Results
Naive Bayes provided high accuracy and performed best for spam classification.
